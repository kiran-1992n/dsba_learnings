Churn Rate Prediction:

Technique used: Logistic regression.


Regression Equation:

y = c + a1x1 + a2x2 + a3x3 + .....

consider c + a1x1 + a2x2 + a3x3 + ..... as a utility function.

The value of this utility fuction varies from -infinity to +infinity.

To get these range from 0 to 1 i.e probability values in logistic regression we use following formula.

(e power - utility / 1 + e power + utility)

KNIME Work flow: Logistic Regression Model

(file: Practice_ship)
1) Excel Reader
2) Number to String
	Target variable 'survived' is of integer type we need to convert it into String type.
3) Partitioning (To split data into Test & Training data)
	To split data into 70:30
	Select Relative Split
	Select Draw Randomly

	Two outputs are available
		1) First Partition (Training Set)
		2) Second Partition (Testing Set)

	Random Seed can be used to get same output across different systems (equalent to randomstate parameter)
4) Logistic Regression Learner (For Training the model)
	First Partition to be connected here.
		Select target column as 'survived'
		select reference category value as '0' (to get output for 1)
		select solver as 'Iteratively Reweighted least squares'
		Select columns required for model building.

	Gives 2 Outputs
		1) Coefficients and statistics
		2) Model Statistics (not so important)
5) Logistic Regression Predictor (For prediction)
	Second Partition to be connected here.
	Connect square o/p of learner to square I/p of predictor.
	Append columns with predicted probabilities (enable check-box), also give column new name.
6)Scorer
	First columns -> Actual o/p 'survived'
	Second column  -> Predicted o/p 'Prediction(survived)'

	It has Two Outputs:
		1) Confusion Matrix (Alternate option view confusion Matrix -> Displays with percentages)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNIME Work flow: Decision Tree

(file: Practice_ship)
1) Excel Reader
2) Number to String
3) Partitioning
4) Decision Tree Learner
	select class column as target variable i.e 'survived'
	** can also set other pruning parameters as required.
5) Decision Tree Predictor
	view decision tree
6) Scorer
	First columns -> Actual o/p 'survived'
	Second column  -> Predicted o/p 'Prediction(survived)'

	It has Two Outputs:
		1) Confusion Matrix (Alternate option view confusion Matrix -> Displays with percentages)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNIME Work flow: Random Forest

(file: Practice_ship)
1) Excel Reader
2) Number to String
3) Partitioning
4) Random Forest Learner
	target column i.e 'survived'
	Use Columns for model building (select required colmns)
	Split Criterion : Information Gain Ratio
5) Random Forest Predictor
	view decision tree
6) Scorer

KNIME Work flow: Customer Churn Rates
(File: Customer_data_Test & Customer_data_Train)
(Here we already have seperate data for Train & Test)

1) Excel Reader (for Train data) + Number to String (For Retained column)
2) Excel Reader (for Test data) + Number to String (For Retained column)
3) Logistic Regression Learner (I/P from Train-data Excel Reader)
	Select target column as 'retained'
	select reference category value as '0' (to get output for 1)
	select solver as 'Iteratively Reweighted least squares'
	Select columns required for model building.
4) Logistic Regression Predictor (I/P from Test-data Excel Reader)
	Connect square o/p of learner to square I/p of predictor.
5) Scorer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After building the Logistic Regression Model.

Get the Coefficients for all Independent variable used in model building.
Get the Std Error for all Independent variable used in model building.
Compute 'Wald Statistic' -> (coeff / std error) ^ 2
Variable with highest Wald Statistic is the one which contributes more in model building. (Model Accuracy)

Market Basket Analysis

Out of previous transactions we give recommendations like preople who bought Set A ( 1 or more items) also bough set B(1 or more items)
Ex: People buying Mobiles also bought Mobile cases in this ex setA is Mobile & Mobile cases is set B

3 Metrices
1) Support Metric -> set A / total baskests
2) Confidence Metric -> set A & set B / set A
3) Lift Metric- > (set A & set B / set A) / (set B / Total baskests) or (Confidence) / (Support of Set B)

-------------------------------------------
KNIME Work flow: Market Basket Analysis

(File : Transactional Data)

1) Excel Reader
2) Cell Splitter
	Select column to split -> 'Billing_sets'
	Enter the delimiter -> ' ' (in this case its a blank space)
	O/P required in 'set' format.
3) Association Rule Learner
	Set support to 0.005
	Minimum Confidence to 0.4

	In O/P
	Items column represent : set A and consequent represent : set B

(File: masterdata has details about product name & price for given product numbers in Transactional Data)

4) Excel Reader -> for reading product details excel
5) Joiner -> to combine both data
	Clk on Add Row
		'Consequent' in first column, 'Product Number_Text_format' in 2nd column,
	Under column selection tab
		Have all columns from 1st table and have only price and product_name from 2nd table
6)Column Rename
	Double clk on columns u intend to rename then rename colmn name
		Consequent -> Rec_Prod_Num
		Price -> Rec_Prod_Price
		Product_Name -> Rec_Prod_Name
7) Ungroup
	Select 'items' column for ungrouping
	Un check 'Remove selected collection column'

	In Output -->  each I/P row creates 'n' number of O/P rows where 'n' is length of items{if 3 product num were present as set in items colmn we get 3 rows in O/P}
8) Joiner -> to combine masterdata excel and ungroup output
	Clk on Add Row
		'items(#1)' in first column, 'Product Number_Text_format' in 2nd column,
	Under column selection tab
		Have all columns from 1st table and have only price and product_name from 2nd table
9) GroupBy
	Under Groups Tab
		Select 'items' which is of st type & Rec_Prod_Num colmns for grouping
	Under Manual Aggregation tab
		Support, Confidence, lift as Mean
		Implie as First (Its a dummy colmn)
		items(#1) as concat
		Rec_Prod_Price as mean
		Rec_Prod_Num as First
		Price as sum
		Product_name as concat

	Column Naming -> Keep Original Naming
6)Column Rename
	Double clk on columns u intend to rename then rename colmn name
		Product_name -> Basket_Product_Name
		Price -> Basket_Price
		items(#1) -> Basket_Item_Num
--------------------- Rules are defined and built Now we will Verify ---------------------------
(File: NewItems)
7) Excel Reader
8) GroupBy
	Under Groups Tab
		Select 'BasketNo' colmn for grouping
	Under Manual Aggregation tab
		items as conact

	Column Naming -> Keep Original Naming
9) Cell Splitter
	Select column to split -> 'items'
	Enter the delimiter -> ',' (in this case its a blank space)
	O/P required in 'set' format.
10) Subset Matcher -> Basically does the job of look up
	It takes 2 I/P
		1) Pass O/P of 9)Cell Splitter
		2) Pass O/P of 6)Column Rename

	Subset Column -> Items colmn of set type
	ID Column -> BasketNo

	Output
		It tells for each transaction / rule recommended sets
11) Joiner -> to combine O/P of 10) Subset Matcher & 6)Column Rename
	Clk on Add Row
	'items' of set type in first column, 'items' of set type in 2nd column,
-----------------------------------------------------------

For a same basket of Products we might have multiple recommendations i.e multiple rules may be present,
--> Preferred rule is the one with highest lift i.e recommendation is the rec_prod with the highest lift value.

Customer Lifetime Value

Measure of how valuable a customer is to the business.
Based on transactions over a period(lifetime).

CLV = Short Term Margin * Long Term Multiplier
Short Term Margin -> Net Margin - Retention Cost
Long Term Multiplier -> (1 + d) / (1 + d - r)
d -> discount factor
r -> retention rate
