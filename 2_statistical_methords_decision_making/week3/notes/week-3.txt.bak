Prelimnaries:

	- Say we have a population of 1 lakh +.
	- We have taken a sample size (n) of 150 customers.
	- We have computed samle mean (x-bar) income as 8 LPA.
	- Sample Error : Diff between samle mean income and the actual income.
	- Assumption : Sample estimate will be reflective of reality.
	- In the same way take few more samples and compute mean (x-bar) of each sample.
	- Several means can be calculated for different samples.
	- Distribution of these means is called sampling disribution of the sample mean.
	
	Ex : Consider a class of 60 studants. Assume marks obtained by studants follow "Normal Distribution".
		 with mean of 70 and Std Deviation of 4. Now suppose we take multiple samples and compute mean of each samples, this Sampling Distribution of 
		 sample means also follow "Normal Distribution" with the same mean 'mu' and with the std deviation (sigma/root(n)) 'n' being the sample size.
		 This (sigma/root(n)) is called "Standard Error"
		 
	Suppose the origial data (marks obtained by studants) don't follow "Normal Distribution" / Bell Curve, all our previous analysis will go vain.
	
Central Limit Theoram:

	Irrespective of the shape of the distribution of the original population, the sampling distribution of the mean will approach a normal 
	distribution as the size of the sample increases and becomes large. 
	[Thumb rule says large means n >= 30]

Hypothesis Basics:

	- A hypothesis is a conjecture, an assumption or a statement which may or may not be true.
	- A statistical hypothesis is a statement about a population parameter. It may or may not be true.
	  The manager has to ascertain the truth of the hypothesis. 
	
	Null & Alternate Hypothesis:
	
		- What you intutively feel is the truth, is the alternate hypothesis -> what you wish to prove.
		- The null hypothesis is formulated such that the rejection of the null hypothesis proves the alternate hypothesis is true.
		- "Null Hypothesis is always tested at equality"
		** We can't have equal sign for Alternate Hypothesis.

		Ex : I know Peter always speaks truth. But I cant prove it.
		
			So Formulate Null hypothesis : Peter is a Liar
			Alternate hypothesis : Peter speaks the truth.
			
		"The Null Hypothesis is formulated such that the rejection of the null hypothesis proves the alternate hypothesis is true."
		
					True		False
		
		Reject		Type-1		No Error
					(alpha)
		
		Accept		No Error	Type-2
								(Beta)
								
		. Alpha is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.
		. Beta is the probability of accepting the null hypothesis when it is false.
		.(1 - alpha ) is the probability of accepting the null hypothesis when it is true.
		. Alpha -> Level of Significance of Test
		.(1 - Alpha) -> level of Confidence of test
		.(1 - Beta) -> Power of the test, how clear is the demarkation b/w null & alternate hypothesis.
		
-> Only null hypothesis can have equality sign
-> Alternate cannot have equality sign
-> Null & alternate should be mutually exclusive

Case Study - Hypothesis Testing:

	Problem : A product manager belives a new product line launch will be dequately profitable only in mkts where mean household income is greater than 29K.
			  Survey of random sample of 400 households in the mkt showed a mean income per household of 30K with Std deviation of 8K.
			  Should the product manager release the new product line?
			  
		- To reach a final decision, product manager has to make a generalinference (about the population) from the sample data
		- Criterion-- mean income across across all households in the market area under consideration
		- If the mean population household income is greater than 29K, product manager should introduce the product line into the new market
		- Decision making is equivalent to either accepting or rejecting the hypothesis.
		
		One Tailed Test:
		
			The term one-tailed signifies that all -ve or z-values that would cause PM's to reject H0, are in just one tail of the sampling distribution.
			
			µ = Population Mean
			H0: µ = 29K --> Null Hypothesis
			Ha: µ > 29K --> Alternate Hypothesis
			
			The Alternate hypothesis indicates a direction - here it is right of the mean.
			One - tailed test on the +ve side - Right Tailed test.
			Alternate hypothesis will never have '=' sign.
			
			Test statistic:
			
				z = (x-bar - mu)/ (sigma/root n)
				
				x-bar -> Estimate - 30K
				mu -> Population mean hypothesized - 29K
				sigma -> Population std deviation - 8K
				n -> Size of Sample - 400
				
				z =2.5
				
				. It is not mentioned about the type of distribution.
				. Applying Central Limit Theoram since n is large (n>30) distribution of x-bar is Normal Distribution.
				. With mean 'mu'(29K) And standard deviation (sigma/root n)
				. When nothing is metioned alpha is taken as 5%. 
				
				. For this value of alpha, 'x' value comes out to be 29.658K and 'z' as 1.645
				
					** Since Excel gives Cumilative Probability and alpha of 5% (Right Tailed test.) means take 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 as Cumilative probability in Excel Computation.
					If it was a negative tail or left tail we need to put 0.05.
					. Excel function --> Norm.s.inv(0.95) gives 1.645, this is the critical value of z.
					. To find critical x-bar value Use , z = (x-bar - mu)/ (sigma/root n) given z = 1.645, sigma = 8K, n = 400 this give critical x-bar value as 29.658K.
				
				. Meaning of above line is 'x' & 'z' values less than above mentined critical values "DO NOT REJECT NULL HYPOTHESIS"
				. If 'x' & 'z' values are more than above mentined critical values "REJECT NULL HYPOTHESIS"
				
				
				. In our case z = 2.5 and falls in rejection region which is greater than critical 'z' value 1.645 so we can "REJECT NULL HYPOTHESIS"
				. The new product line can be released to current mkt with 95% cofidence level.
				
			Steps to Solve:
			
				- Draw the diagram bell-curve.
				- Mark the Critical Region, Acceptance Region & Rejection Region.
				- Compute the 'z' value.
				- Get the critical 'z' value.
				- Based on the relation (greater/lesser) b/w computed 'z' and critical 'z' we decide to Reject/Accept Null HYPOTHESIS.
				
			P-Value: Actual Significance Value
			
				If x-bar is 30K & z is 2.5 what is the Probability that z>= 2.5 
				
				In Excel Norm.s.dist(2.5) = 0.994
				
				Sincce we need Probability/area for z>= 2.5 it is 1 - 0.994 = 0.006
				
				This value is sometimes called the actual significance level, or the p-value. This is the level at which the null hypothesis gets rejected.
				- 'p' value gives you the actual risk or level of significance by which null hypothesisis rejected.
				
			Solution Method -1 :
				Whem p < alpha Null Hypothesis is rejected.
				
			Solution Method -2 :
				If the computed z falls in rejection Region reject the Null Hypothesis.(Critical value of z helps to find rejection region)

Hypothesis Testing - Inline Question:

	A retailer is weighing strawberries to sell as 250g punnets. A customer has complained that strawberries he had bought previously weighed under 250g. The
	retailer decides to check the weight of 36 punnets. He finds that the average weight is 248.5g. with standard deviation 4.8g. In using a significance test to judge
	whether he is selling under-weight punnets, which of the following conclusions is correct?
	
	a. At 5% level he is selling under weight.
	b. At 5% level he is not selling under weight.
	c. At 5% level the test is inconclusive.
	d. A significance test is inappropriate in this case.
	
	Soln: Lets formulate Null & Alternate hypothesis
	
		H0: µ = 250 --> Null Hypothesis
		H1: µ < 250 --> Alternate Hypothesis
		
		The Alternate hypothesis indicates a direction - here it is left of the mean.
		One - tailed test on the -ve side - Left Tailed test.
	
		x-bar -> 248.5
		sigma -> 4.8
		n -> 36
		mu -> 250
		
		z = (x-bar - mu)/ (sigma/root n)
		z = -1.875 --> z - computed.
		
		Lets find the critical Region:
		
			let's take alpha as 5% or 0.05
			now lets find z-critical for this Probability of 0.05
			Using Excel Norm.s.inv(0.05) = -1.645 [Since it's a left Tailed we find Norm.s.inv for 0.05 not 1 - 0.05]
			
			So from LHS to z = -1.645 is a Rejection Region.
			
			z - computed which is -1.875 falls in this Rejection Region. So Null Hypothesis can be rejected.
			
		So Correct option is 'a' At 5% level he is selling under weight.
		
Hypothesis Formulation Exercises :

	State the Null and Alternative Hypothesis for the following:

	1)  Is the average waiting time for the customers of Smart Supermarket at the checkouts greater than 15 minutes?
		Null Hypothesis H0 -> mu = 15
		Alternate Hypothesis H1 -> mu >15
		
	2) Is the proportion of households owning Color TVs in Chennai less than 0.4?
		Null Hypothesis H0 -> pi = 0.4
		Alternate Hypothesis H1 -> pi < 0.4
		
	3) Is the average expenditure per household on eating out significantly higher in Bangalore than in Calcutta?
		Null Hypothesis H0 ->mu_bang == mu_cal
		Alternate Hypothesis H1 -> mu_bang > mu_cal
		
	4) Two random sample surveys, conducted with two months gap between the two, assessed public opinions on the outcome: The
	question that was posed was “If the general election was going to take place tomorrow, would you cast your vote for or against the ruling party?”
	
		** This is a two-tailed test.
		
		Null Hypothesis H0 -> pi1 == pi2
		Alternate Hypothesis H1 -> pi1 != pi2
		
----------------------------------------------------------------------
T - Test:

	Above test was "Z-Test". Z-Test has few limitations:
		- It requres all values for computation of 'z' (mu, x-bar, n, sigma)
		- Sample size 'n' should be reater than or equal to 30.
		
	Inferental ststs is all about studying the sample and inferring to Population, might be due to constrints of time and availability of resources.
	
	In todays time we have sufficient resourcesto store & process large mount of data,  to study about population instead of studying Samples 
	and then infering to Population.

	Degrees of freedom:
	
		Consider 4 chairs in a room.
		
		1st person entering room has 4 options to select.
		2nd person entering room has 3 options to select.
		3rd person entering room has 2 options to select.
		4th person entering room has only 1 options to select.
		
		In general for size 'n' , n-1 will have choices 2 or more so te degree of freedom for size 'n' is n-1.
	
	One Sample T-test:
	
		t = (x-bar - mu)/ (s / root n)
		
		x-bar -->sample mean
		mu --> hypothesized mean
		n --> sample size
		s --> sample std deviation
		
		degrees of freedon -> n-1
		
	Problem: One Sample T - test
		
		Experian Marketing Services reported that the typical American spends a mean of 144 minutes (2.4 hours) per day accessing the
		Internet via a mobile device. (Source: The 2014 Digital Marketer, available at ex.pn/1kXJjfX.) In order to test the validity of this
		statement, you select a sample of 30 friends and family. The results for the time spent per day accessing the Internet via mobile device (in
		minutes) are stored in InternetMobileTime.csv .
		
		1) Is there evidence that the population mean time spent per day accessing the Internet via mobile device is different from 144 minutes?
		Use the p-value approach and a level of significance of 0.05.
		
		Soln:
			Step-1:
				H0 : mu == 144
				H1 : mu != 144
				
			Step-2 :
				alpha = 0.05
				
			Step-3 : One Sample T-test [z-test can't be performed since Population std deviation is not known]
				t = (x-bar - mu)/ (s / root n) 
				
				mu = 144; n = 30;
				s = 139.84; x-bar = 175.267; [These two values are calculated for given samples in csv file]
				
				t = 1.225
				
			Step-4 : Finding p value
				Using Excel Function: 
					TDIST(t-value, degree of freedom, one/two tailed test)
					
					TDIST(1.225, (30-1),2) = 0.2305 
					[Degree of freedom is n-1, here Alternate hypothesis talks about not equal it can tke both leethan or greaterthan sp its 2 tailed test]
					
			Step-5 :
				p-value computed > alpha
				0.2305 > 0.05 
				
			Hence we fail to reject Null Hypothesis.
			With 95% confidence we can tell typical American spends a mean of 144 minutes (2.4 hours) per day accessing theInternet via a mobile device.

	Two Sample T -test:

		here degree of freedom is 'n1 + n2 - 2'
		
		denominator = under root [(s1-square / n1) + (s2-square / n2)]
		
		t = (x1-bar - x2-bar) / denominator
		
		Problem: Two Sample T -test
		
			A hotel manager looks to enhance the initial impressions that hotel guests have when they check in. Contributing to initial impressions is
			the time it takes to deliver a guest’s luggage to the room after checkin. A random sample of 20 deliveries on a particular day were selected
			in Wing A of the hotel, and a random sample of 20 deliveries were selected in Wing B. The results are stored in Luggage.csv . Analyze the
			data and determine whether there is a difference between the mean delivery times in the two wings of the hotel. (Use a = 0.05.)
			
		Soln: 
			
			Step-1 :
				H0 : muA == muB
				H1 : muA != muB
				
			Step-2 :
				alpha = 0.05
				
			Step-3 : Two Sample T -test
				denominator = under root [(s1-square / n1) + (s2-square / n2)]
				t = (x1-bar - x2-bar) / denominator
				
				n1 = n2 = 20
				
				x1-bar = 10.397 ; x2-bar = 8.123 ; s1-square =  1.877; s2-squre = 2.008 ; 
				[These values are calculated for given samples in csv file]
				
				t = 5.162
				
			Step-4 : Finding p value
				Using Excel Function: 
					TDIST(t-value, degree of freedom, one/two tailed test)
					
					degree of freedom = n1 + n2 - 2 = 20 + 20 - 2 = 38 
					
					TDIST(5.162, 38, 2) = 8.007E-06
					
			Step-5 :
				p-value computed < alpha
				8.007E-06 < 0.05
				
			Hence we can reject Null Hypothesis
			With 95% confidence we can tell there is a difference between the mean delivery times in the two wings of the hotel.

	Paired T - test
	
		Example : Compute Blood Pressure of patients before and after medications.
		
		** Condition here is number of observations before & after should be same.
		
		t = d-bar / (sd / root-n)
		
		d-bar --> Average of the paired difference
		n --> sample size
		sd --> Std deviation of the paired difference
		
		degree of freedom = n - 1
		
		
		Problem:
		
			The file Concrete.csv contains compressive strength of 40 samples of concrete taken 2 & 7 days after pouring.
			At 0.01 level of significance is there evidance that the mean strength is lower at 2 days than at 7 days.
			
		Soln:
		
			Step-1:
				H0: mu2 == mu7
				H1: mu2 < mu7
				
			Step-2 :
				alpha = 0.01
				
			Step-3 : Paired T - test
			
				First compute difference b/w 7days & 2days as new colmn
				
				d-bar -> mean of new colmn = 0.553
				sd -> std deviation of new colmn = 0.373
				n -> 40
				degree of freedom = n - 1 = 39
				
				t = d-bar / (sd / root-n) = 9.372
				
			Step-4 : Finding p value
				Using Excel Function: 
					TDIST(t-value, degree of freedom, one/two tailed test)
					
					TDIST(9.372, 39, 1) = 7.76E-12
					
			Step-5 :
				p-value computed < alpha
				7.76E-12 < 0.01
				
			Hence we can reject Null Hypothesis.
			With 99% confidence we can tell mean strength is lower at 2 days than at 7 days

Chi - Square Test:

	To understand the direction of association of numerical variables / continuous variables we have correlation.
	Similarly for categorical variables we have chi-square test.
	
	x-sq --> Test Statistic
	Summation --> The sum of
	
	O --> Observed Frequencies
	E --> Expected Frequencies
	
	x-sq = Summation [ (0 - E) square / E]
	
	degree of freedom = (m-1)(n-1) m,n represent rows n colmns in a cross tab.

		Step-1 :
			H0 : There is no influence of background on Promotion
			H1 : Promotions are biased.
			
		Step-2 :
			alpha = 0.05
			
		Step-3 :
			
			From above given table 
				promoting percentage (ir-respective of Background) 31/55 = 56.4%
				not promoting percentage 24/55 = 43.6%
				
			Expected colmn values are computed by multiplying above percentages with total num of Employess of Comp-A & Comp-B
			[24*56.4% = 13.5, 24*43.6% = 10.5, 31*56.4% = 17.5, 31*43.6% = 13.5]

				p-value = CHIDIST(0.65,1) = 0.419
				
		Step-5 :
