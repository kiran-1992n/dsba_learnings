Uncertainity & Volatility:

	- Risk is measured by Std Deviation.
	- Completely which we cannot foresee there is uncertainity & an event which we cannot foresee will increase the risk.
	- Uncertainity + Risk is measure of Volatility.
	
Probability: Refers to chance / Likelyhood of particular event taking place.
	
Event : Outcome of an Experiment.

Experiment : It is a process that is performed to understand & observe possible outcomes.

Sample Space : Set of all outcomes of an experiment.

Probability of an event A is defined as ratio of m & n, where m is number of ways that are fsvorable to the occurance of A & n is total number of outcomes of experiment. Value lies b/w 0 & 1.

3 Extreme values : Certainity(100%), Equally Likely(50%), Impossibility(0%)

-----------------------------
Types of Probability:

	1) A Priori Classical Probability.
		- Based on concept of sample space
		- Based on concept of Mathematical Axiom
	
	2)Empirical Probability(Relative Frequency Probability)
		- Based on Data.
		- Data Driven.
	
	3) Subjective Probability
		- Derived from an Induvisual's personal judgement about weather a specific outcome is likely to occur. 
		
	2 & 3 are regularlu used in Industry. 1 is a theoritical one.
	
Mutually Exclusive Events:
	Two events A & B are said to be mutually exclusive if the occurance of A prevents the ocurrance of B and vice-versa.
	
Independent Events:
	Two events A & B are said to be Independent if the occurance of A has no effect on ocurrance of B and vice-versa.
	In other words occurance of A doesn't influence occurance of B and vice-versa.

-----------------------------
Rules for Computing Probability:

	1) Addition Rule - Mutually Exclusive Events
		P(A union B) = P(A) + P(B)
		
	2) Addition Rule - Not Mutually Exclusive Events
		P(A union B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A intersection B)
		
	Example : From a pack of well shuffled cards, a card is picked up at random
	
		1) what is the probability that a card is King or a Queen
		soln: p(K) = 4/52
			  p(Q) = 4/52
			  P(K union Q) = 4/52 + 4/52 = 8/52 = 2/13
			  
		2) what is the probability that a card is King or a Diamond
		soln: p(K) = 4/52
			  p(D) = 4/52
			  P(K intersection D) = 1/52 There is one King card which is also a Diamond.
			  P(K union Q) = 4/52 + 13/52 - 1/54 = 16/52 = 4/13
			  
	3) Multiplication Rule - Independent Events
		P(A intersection B) = P(A).P(B)
		
	3) Multiplication Rule - Non-Independent Events
		P(A intersection B) = P(A).P(B/A) 
		P(B/A) - Conditional Probability, P(B) given that A has already ocurred.
		
	Example : Probability of Raj getting grade A in subject 'X' is 0.6 and grade A in subject 'Y' is 0.4.Assume these 2 courses are Independent.
	
		1) What is the Probability of Raj getting grade A in both 'X & 'Y'
		soln: P(X) = 0.6
			  P(Y) = 0.4
			  P(X intersection Y) = 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24
			  
	Example : From a pack of cards, 2 cards are drawn in succession one after the other. After draw selected card is not replaced.
	
		1) What is the probability that both the draws you get diamonds.
		soln: P(1st Diamond) = 13/52
			  P(2nd Diamond) = 12/51 (beacuse 1st card drawn is not replaced) (1st card drawn is already diamond)
			  P(both are Diamond) = 13/52 * 12/51 = 1/17

-----------------------------
Marginal Probability:
	
	The term Marginal, is used to indicate that the Probabilityis calculated using Contingency Table.

	Contingency Table:
	
		- The table displays sample values in relation to two different variables that may be dependent or contingent on one another. 
		- Consists of Rows & Colmns of 2 attributes at different levels with freq or numbers in each of cells.
		- It is a matrix of freq assigned to rows & colmns.

	Ex: Of The cars on a used car lot, 70% have AC & 40% have CD Player, 20% have both.

		1) What is the Probability that a car has CD Player given that it has AC?
		soln: we need to find P(CD|AC) 
		
		Attributs		CD		noCD		Marginal-Total
		AC				*20		50			*70
		noAC			20		10			30
		Marginal-Total  *40		60			100
		
		In the above table values starting with * are given. Using these values other values are calculated.
		
		From the above table: There are total 70 cars with AC out of which 20 have CD
		P(CD|AC) =  20/70
		
		AC = ACCD + ACnoCD (AC associated with CD + AC associated with no CD)
		CD = CDAC + CDnoAC
		
		- P(AC) & P(CD) is Marginal Probability because it depends on sum (as mentioned above)
		- P(CD|AC) is Conditional Probability [P(CD) given it has AC]
		- P(AC and CD) is Joint Probability

-----------------------------
Bayes' Theoram:

	- It s an extention of conditional Probability.
	- Given P(A|B) we need P(B|A), Bayes theoram will give the solution to us.
	- Here we rae Inverting the Probability.
	
	Problem:
		- A drilling company has estimated 40% chance of striking oil for their new well.
		- Detailed test has been scheduled for more info. Historically 60% of successful wells had detailed Tests. And 20% of unsuccessful wells had detailed tests.
		- given that current well has scheduled for detailed test. What is Probability that well will be successfull.
		
	Soln : 
		We have ->  Probability of Detailed Tests given Successful wells.
		We need ->  Probability of successful wells/operation given Detailed Test.
		
		Attributes			Successful		Un-Successful	Marginal-Total
		DetailedTest		*24				*12				36
		No-DetailedTest 	16				48				64
		Marginal-Total		*40				60				100
		
		In the above table values starting with * are given. Using these values other values are calculated.
		
		60% of 40 is 24
		20% of 60 is 12
		
		Probability of successful wells given Detailed Test
		P(S|DT) = 24/36 = 2/3 = 0.67 or 67%

Probability Distribution:

	- Total listing of the various values the random variable can take along with the corresponding probability of each value.
	- A real life example could be pattern distribution of machine breakdown in manufacturing unit.(Random Variable here is various values machine breakdown could assume.)
	- Also called as observed distribution.
	- Three types :
		-  Binomial Distribution & Poisson Distribution are discrete distributions.
		-  Normal Distribution is continuous distribution.
		
-----------------------------
Normal Distribution:

	- According to Empericle rule in a bell curve/Normal Distribution:
		- 68% of data points lies between mean(µ) + std deviation(σ) and mean(µ) - std deviation(σ)
		- 95% of data points lies between mean(µ) + 2*std deviation(σ) and mean(µ) - 2*std deviation(σ)
		- 99.7% of data points lies between mean(µ) + 3*std deviation(σ) and mean(µ) - 3*std deviation(σ)
		
	- Normal Distribution is life of Statistics.
	
	- Probability of normal distribution is simply the area under the curve with given boundaries.
	
	Properties of Normal Distribution:
	
		- Continuous Distribution looking like a bell hence Statisticians use expression "Bell Shaped Distribution".
		- It is symmetrical about its mean
		- It's mean, median and mode values are equal.
		- It has an infinite range 
		
	Example: Mean(µ) weight of a breakfast pack is 0.295 kg with std deviation(σ) of 0.025kg.
			 The random variable weight of pack follows normal distribution.
			 
			 1)What is the Probability that the pack weighs less than 0.280kg?
			 soln:  Way-1) Select Norm.Dist in excel function and feed all values. Feed Cumilative Value as 1. And get the result.
					Way-2) Select Norm.S.Dist in excel function and feed all values. Feed Cumilative Value as 1. And get the result.
					here z = (x - µ)/σ
					
					** Here x value is less than µ so Excel gives direct value.
					
			2)What is the Probability that the pack weighs more than 0.350kg?
			soln:  Find the value using any of above ways.
			
				** Here x value is more than µ so subtract the result given above by 1 to get result.
				
			3)What is the Probability that the pack weights b/w 0.26kg & 0.34kg?
			soln: here Result is  -->  Cumilative Probability for 0.34 - Cumilative Probability for 0.26
			
			---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			
			4) What weight of the pack produced would have been exceeded by 90% of packs produced?
			soln : here we need to find 'x' random variable value.
			
			- Need to find a point 'x' such that, starting from 'x' and extending infinitely rightside, area under curve should be 0.9
			- ** In other words area under curve starting from left upto 'x' should be 0.1(1 - 0.9)
			- Way-1) In excel function use Norm.Inv() and feed values. And get 'x' value
			- Way-2) In excel function use Norm.S.Inv() and feed values and the result we get is 'z'
			  using z = (x - µ)/σ compute 'x'
			  
			---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			
			import scipy.stats as stats
			
			z = (x - µ)/σ
			stats.norm.cdf(z)
			
			  
-----------------------------
Bonomial Distribution:

	- Widely used Probability Distribution of a discrete random variable.
	- Plays major role in Quality Control & Quality Assurace.
	- Manufacturing units use it for defective Analysis.
	- Reducing the number of defectives using proportion defective control chart(p-chart) is accepted practice.
	- It is also being service organizations like banks & insurance corporations to get idea of proportion customers who are satisfied with service quality.
	
	Conditions for applying Binomial Distribution(Bernouli Principle):
	
		- Trials are independent and normal.
		- There are fixed number of trials(n).
		- There are only 2 outcomes Success & Failure.
		- Probability of success is uniform throughout the n trials.
		
	Example : A bank has issued credit cads. Based on past data bank has found 60% of people pay on time following the bill.
			  
			  If a sample of 7 accounts are selected at randomly from DB Construct Binomial Probability Distribution of accounts paying on time.
			  
		Soln: 	Create 3 colmns in excel 1)'X' 2)'P(X)' 3)CP(X). 
				'X' takes values 0 to 7 since n given here is 7
				Select Binom.Dist in excel function for P(X) colmn and feed all values.Feed Cumilative Value as 0. And get the result.
				Select Binom.Dist in excel function for CP(X) colmn and feed all values.Feed Cumilative Value as 1. And get the result. This is Cumilative.
	----------------------------------------------------------------
		X taking values 0 to 7 means 
			x=0 P(X) give probability of 0 customers paying on time out of 7 customers
			x=1 P(X) give probability of 1 customers paying on time out of 7 customers
			x=2 P(X) give probability of 2 customers paying on time out of 7 customers
			and so on....
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	Observation : Sice probability given here is 60% or 0.6 the max probability is found at 'x' = 0.6*7 = 4 (nearer to 4.2)
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	
	import scipy.stats as stats
	import numpy as np
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	
	n = 7
	p = 0.6
	k = np.arange(0,8)
	
	binom_dist = stats.binom.pmf(k,n,p)
	
	cumilative_binom_dist = stats.binom.cdf(k,n,p)
	
-----------------------------
Poisson Distribution:

	- It also plays major role in Quality Control.
	- To find number of cars arriving at highway checkpost per hour.
	- Number of people visiting bank per hour during peak business period.
	
	Poisson Process:

		- Probability of getting exactly 1 success in a continuous interval like length, area, time is constant.
		- Probability of success in any one interval is independent of Probability of success in any other interval.
		- Probability of getting more than 1 success in an interval is 0.
		
		. No fixed number of trials as in BD. ( n is infinite)
		. When 'n' is very large, n*pi will always be a constant lambda.
		. Now the BD approached PD.
		
	Example: If on an average 6 customers arrive every 2 mins at a bank during the busy hours of working.
	
			1) what is the probability that exactly 4 customers arrive in a given minute? P(X=4)
			soln : 6 customers arrive every 2 mins ->  3 customers arrive every 1 min, hence lambda = 3.
			In Excel select Poisson.Dist and feed all values. x = 4, mean = 3 cumilative = 0 and get result
			
			2) what is the probability that morethan 3 customers arrive in a given minute? P(X>3) = 1 - P(X<=3)
			soln : 6 customers arrive every 2 mins ->  3 customers arrive every 1 min, hence lambda = 3.
			In Excel select Poisson.Dist and feed all values. x = 3, mean = 3 cumilative = 1 and get answer
			Final result is 1 - answer .
			
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	
	import scipy.stats as stats
	import numpy as np
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	
	lambda_val = 3
	n = np.arange(0,20)
	poisson_dist = stats.poisson.pmf(n, lambda_val) # gives array of respective probability values.
	cumilative_poisson = stats.poisson.cdf(n, lambda_val) # gives array of cumilative probability values.
			
		
-----------------------------
Diff Between Poisson & Binomial Distribution:

	1)Number of defective Laptops in a lot of 'n' laptops is Binomial Distribution.
	  Number of defects in a laptop which makes it a defective one is Poisson Distribution

	2)Number of people unhappy with a service is Binomial Distribution.
	  Number of complains each person is having beacause of which they are unhappy with a service is Poisson Distribution
