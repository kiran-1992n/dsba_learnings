Kinds of Risk:

	Credit Risk -> Will People (borrowers) pay back ?
	Market Risk -> Are prices going up or down ?
	Liquidity Risk -> Will we have enough cash ?
	Operational Risk -> Is anyone trying to rob thr bank?
	Systemic Risk -> Will new regulations lead to harder times?

Credit Risk:

	Aspects of Credit Risk Regulators choose to focus on:

		1) Probability of Default (PD)
				- Chance of Non-Repayment.
				- Number between 0 & 1.

		2) Exposure at Default (EAD)
				- When default happens, How much of Bank's money is at risk.
				- Total of all defaults.
				- It is in terms of rupees / dollers in respective curreny.

		3) Loss Given Default (LGD)
				- Once default has happened , Bank tries to recover it so how much of total amout it failed to recover.
				- A person took a $100 home loan & defaulted. Bank sold the house @ $80 to recover loan.
				- Here $100 - $80 = $20 , 20% is the LGD.

Credit Risk Modeling:

	1) Logistic Regression -> For finding PD 
	2) Linear Regression -> Dor finding EAD

Credit Risk Loss Distributions:

	The overall loss distribution is similar to normal distribution.
	Where mean's are treated as expected losses & UnExpected losses are treated as Std Deviation.
	
	For a given portfolio of 'n' size
	
	Expected Loss(EL) = Summation i = 1 to n (PD(i) * EAD(i) * LGD(*))
	
	Variance = (Summation i = 1 to n (ro(i) * sigma(i))) power of 2
		
		ro(i) -> Std Dev of ith element in portfolio
		sigma(i) -> correlation b/w ith element & portfolio.

	Unexpected Loss = Summation i = 1 to n (ro(i) * sigma(i))
